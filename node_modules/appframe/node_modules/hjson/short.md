  Why?

  JSON is a great tool that does its job very well. Maybe too well. JSON is a
  great hammer but not everything is a nail.

  Configuration files are edited by end-users, not developers. Users should not
  have to worry about putting commas in the correct place. Software should
  empower the user not hinder him.

  "JSON": "is Hjson",

  but: commas and quotes are optional!
  and: those are allowed: // /**/ #
  so:  less mistakes, more comments ;-)
}

// See [hjson.org](http://hjson.org) for JavaScript, Python, C# and tools.
